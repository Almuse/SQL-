Here I created a Fantasy Shop Items List.

/** Items list: 
potions (5)
swords (3)
sheilds (3)
axes (2)
bows (2)
**/

CREATE TABLE items (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER );

INSERT INTO items VALUES (1, "potions", 5);
INSERT INTO items VALUES (2, "swords", 3);
INSERT INTO items VALUES (3, "sheilds", 3);
INSERT INTO items VALUES (4, "axes", 2);
INSERT INTO items VALUES (5, "bows", 2);

SELECT * FROM items;

Here I made tables of the "Lords and Ladies of Middle Earth":

CREATE TABLE Lords_of_Middle_Earth (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT, age INTEGER, race TEXT, skill TEXT);

INSERT INTO Lords_of_Middle_Earth VALUES (1, "Elrond", 8000, "elf", "Councler");
INSERT INTO Lords_of_Middle_Earth VALUES
(2, "Aragorn", 100, "dúnedain", "king");
INSERT INTO Lords_of_Middle_Earth VALUES
(3, "Samwise", 30, "hobbit", "gardner");
INSERT INTO Lords_of_Middle_Earth VALUES
(4, "Farimir", 50, "human", "duke");
INSERT INTO Lords_of_Middle_Earth VALUES
(5, "Gimli", 60, "dwarf", "soldier");
INSERT INTO Lords_of_Middle_Earth VALUES
(6, "Gandalf", 8000, "maiar", "wizard");
INSERT INTO Lords_of_Middle_Earth VALUES
(7, "Legolas", 3000, "elf", "archer");
INSERT INTO Lords_of_Middle_Earth VALUES
(8, "Pippin", 30, "hobbit", "gaurd");


CREATE TABLE Ladies_of_Middle_Earth (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT, age INTEGER, race TEXT, skill TEXT);
